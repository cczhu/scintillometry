Dispersion (`scintillometry.dispersion`)
****************************************

Introduction
============

Radio waves travelling through ionized interstellar medium experience a
frequency-dependent slowing of the signal group velocity known as dispersion.
The `scintillometry.dispersion` module provides functionality for storing and
utilizing the dispersion measure, which is related to the delay in arrival time
of radio signals due to the cumulative effects of dispersion. In particular,
the module handles dedispersion, the correction of dispersion in data.
